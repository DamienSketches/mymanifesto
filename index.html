 <center><p class="line1">Art is all I know. It is all I can do..... </p></center>
   <center><p class="line2"> After all, school was and still is a struggle. Ever since I was young,</p></center>
   <center><p class="line3"> I struggled immensely in school- disabilities, mental illnesses, and- being bullied every day; </p></center>
   <center><p class="line4"> does not make the learning experience easy. Especially having no help  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line5"> and the ability to get diagnosed (to know yourself better) and understand you can't control these things. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line6"> I got better in other areas of schooling by having to try so much  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line7"> longer and harder than my other peers leading to sobbing fits. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line8"> Art is my safe place, freedom, and outlet for my excessive daydreams and frustrations. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line9"> Drafting and Sketching my way through life to coping skills. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line10"> That freedom that sketching gives me is like a medicine that makes me giggle and smile. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line11"> But, art is not always positive for me, I struggle with my art. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line12"> I have to think very intentionally and keep in mind all the education </p></center>
   <center><p class="line13"> I got since coming to college to keep my finished art looking the way it does; </p></center>
   <center><p class="line14"> even if I do it in my own "Damien" way of understanding. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line15"> From elementary to high school- I was bullied for many reasons, one of them; being my art. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line16"> It created a toxic view of myself as an artist and the art I produced.  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line17"> I constantly got compared to my friends saying- my art was dog shit  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line18"> compared to theirs, among other things, even though I was trying to learn. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line19"> That bullying and self-view still have their claws on me today.  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line20"> I work myself to death just trying to get a sliver of approval </p></center>
   <center><p class="line21"> and hide my work from the public/internet, terrified to get those same comments.</p></center>
   <center><p class="line22"> I have to force myself to like my art at times- while trying not to  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line23"> throw away a piece I work so hard on every time. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line24"> College was the first time I got meaningful praise, compliments, and admiration </p></center>
   <center><p class="line25"> for my work. It always makes me sob when I get out of class.  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line26"> The reasoning is as they mean so much to me. I feel un-deserving every time I get </p></center>
   <center><p class="line27"> them as I struggle with imposter syndrome. I am slowly trying to work on my issues,  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line28"> and it has allowed me to be better at art and genuinely like my work regardless.   </p></center>
   <center><p class="line29"> I started working for myself and sketching to my heart's content to feel freedom again. </p></center>
   <center><p class="line30"> I want- no, I need to show the world my characters and story.  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line31"> I hope to inspire the people who see it too.  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line32"> I want to be meaningful and silly: Also, I want emotions to be felt.  </p></center>
   <center><p class="line33">  All I have to do is sketch until it works..</p></center>
